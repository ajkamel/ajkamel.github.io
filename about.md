<p class="message">
Programming is something that I have become seriously passionate about over the past year.
 During the past three months I've strengthened my knowledge of and learned about new and existing languages such as Javascript, Ruby, jQuery, SQL.  Along with the languages explored I even exercised some good old Test and Behavior Driven Development using Rspec and Jasmine in an agile fashion.

I am also of the mindset that life is a long journey filled with many lessons to be learned. As you will see below, some of the things that I am passionate about outside of programming is, officiating soccer at a high level and participating in activities that allow me to flex my mental and physical energies from training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to Scuba Diving.

Taking these experiences, I look to turn the lessons and ideas learned into something inspiring and useful.
