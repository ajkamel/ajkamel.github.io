<p class="message">
I am of the mindset that life is a long journey filled with many lessons to be learned. Some of the things that I am passionate about outside of programming is, officiating soccer at a high level and participating in activities that allow me to flex my mental and physical energies from training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to Scuba Diving.

Taking these experiences, I look to turn the lessons and ideas learned into something inspiring and useful.
