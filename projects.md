###TrippinDots
<a href="https://github.com/alexshook/trippindots" target="_blank">see the code</a>

We're visualizing songs with dots using the Echo Nest and iTunes APIs. The concept was to create dots the represent the intensity of a note or sound and break the representation into to segments based on the Echonest analysis. The user can search for a song and it will pull the data load it and represent it dynamically.

Team Members: Alex Shook, Ash Kamel, Jesse Sessler, Verner D'souza

Tripping dots was created during an 8 hour hackathon at the Etsy Month Music Hackathon
