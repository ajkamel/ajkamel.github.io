title: CSS references in Jekyll
---

If you are using Jekyll as a blogging platform you might have noticed about two months ago there was an update to the way it handles url's especially in the way that you can test your page url's locally.  I found that since they added the ``baseurl:`` to the configuration it changed the way my css files were being referenced.  

If you in the past used ``url:`` in your _config.yml file you now need to set a ``baseurl:  / `` if you want your files to route to your css correctly.
